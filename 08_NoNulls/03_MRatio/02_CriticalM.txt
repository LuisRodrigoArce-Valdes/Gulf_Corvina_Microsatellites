sample size = 374
4*Ne*(mutation rate) = 3.226
% larger mutations = 0.1
mean larger mutation size = 3.5

Mean M = 0.841856
95% of equilibrium values of M should be above
Mc = 0.733712
where M = number of alleles / range in allele size
and range = (size of largest allele - size of smallest allele + 1)
